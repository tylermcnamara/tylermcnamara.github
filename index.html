               <p>Everywhere you look in this world there is light,<br>
               there will always be shadows to be found as well<br>
               As long as there is the concept of victors,<br>
               the vanquished will also exist. The selfish intent<br>
                of trying to keep peace, innitiates war<br>
                Hatred is born to protect love. There are nexus<br>
                relationships that cannot be seperated<br>
